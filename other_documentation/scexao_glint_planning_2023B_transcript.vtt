1
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.960
Barnaby Norris: Yep, good idea.

2
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.500
Eckhart Spalding: Okay, so welcome everyone to the planning meeting for the Glen's hardware upgrade

3
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:27.469
Eckhart Spalding: in 2023 B. So first, why don't I give you a highest level sense of what it is that we were hoping to do?

4
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.480
In the coming weeks and months? So

5
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.880
Eckhart Spalding: Glenn, I mean, I'm I'm sure you're familiar with glint. But the the objective now is for us to install a

6
00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:47.890
Eckhart Spalding: a new chip that can do some new things compared to the old chip. And there's going to be some optics that we would like to change out

7
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:58.230
Eckhart Spalding: from the glint test bench, and if possible, also a couple of alignment mirrors just upstream of the of the the injected beam.

8
00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:08.890
Eckhart Spalding: So so the highest level goals are remove Glenn from the bench and set up in a helo lab where Steph Barnaby and I can work on it.

9
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:24.330
Eckhart Spalding: We were hoping to work on it during the the gap between observing runs in October and I mentioned the 2 alignment mirrors in the Ir bench. I'll show you a diagram of those 2

10
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.499
Eckhart Spalding: and where they're located, and then, really install glint and our ambitious

11
00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:38.459
as a deadline, for that is by October twentieth, so we want to be in time for those observing runs in October and November.

12
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:47.999
Eckhart Spalding: The fallback. If we don't make that is to use the the gap, and observing runs in the middle of November.

13
00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.070
Eckhart Spalding: So at the bottom of this slide I have cut out of a a little gantt chart

14
00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:06.059
where I use the the slides that were shown in the Stexio, all hands meeting to indicate. When you have observing runs, those are the dark red

15
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:13.100
Eckhart Spalding: and then the light red were indicated to be times when it's difficult to make hardware upgrades

16
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:35.300
Eckhart Spalding: because the the sexio folks have have other constraints on their their time and and whatnot. But but skexio is not actually on sky. So from our end we have some off the shelf optics that still need to come in we were hoping to just have those shipped directly to Hilo.

17
00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:52.479
Eckhart Spalding: and the the chip is in the final design stages right now and will be fabricated soon. And I'll I'll repeat this this again chart on on the following slides. But

18
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.429
Eckhart Spalding: basically we would look at a Clint removal around October 6 or so.

19
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:08.650
Eckhart Spalding: Upgrade things in the lab, and this purple stretch reinstall, and then hope to use on skytime. In yeah, in October, November. So if I break that down a little bit.

20
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.360
Eckhart Spalding: the first 5 steps of this general sequence.

21
00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:26.760
Eckhart Spalding: would be. Yeah. I already mentioned these ship optics directly to Hilo. Barnaby, Steph and I were hoping to travel. Maybe October sixth. Steph is is graduating a couple of days before.

22
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:36.999
Eckhart Spalding: And Barnaby is planning on returning to Australia earlier than Steph and I. We would stay behind and work on the clients, optics

23
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.040
Eckhart Spalding: and depending on the timing constraints.

24
00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.069
Eckhart Spalding: On Scexo side we were hoping to open the ir bench

25
00:03:46.150 --> 00:04:04.269
Eckhart Spalding: and install Newport. Conex mounts just before the injection beam again in that October gap following that you know, Steph and I will just continue to troubleshoot glint alignment in the lab with an artificial source.

26
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:10.640
Eckhart Spalding: And then reinstall on the summit. We do need to make sure that we understand

27
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:19.180
Eckhart Spalding: exactly how we're going to plug the fiber going from the glint chip to the new C red one imager for dispersed imaging.

28
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:32.699
Eckhart Spalding: and then do on the mountain tests with an artificial source as insofar as as possible. And what we are hoping to observe on sky first of all is just a bright star as an engineering target.

29
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:38.689
Eckhart Spalding: And then there are a couple of targets that are good, low contrast, binary system targets

30
00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:50.919
Eckhart Spalding: that we'd like to observe after that. So we looked at the subaru schedule for 20 twenty-threeb. And it seemed like there is engineering time on these nights

31
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.380
Eckhart Spalding: or possibilities of taking engineering on sky data

32
00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:03.919
Eckhart Spalding: and you can tell us if you know how how well or how badly those dates work. Or if there's a possibility on some other date or whatever.

33
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.539
Eckhart Spalding: So that's just the general sequence of events.

34
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:18.649
Eckhart Spalding: Basically, what's going to change with Glenn proper is the chip like I mentioned the chip is way up in the top right corner in these plots

35
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.760
and

36
00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.089
Eckhart Spalding: to accommodate that new chip. We are

37
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.890
removing the mount that it's on and replacing it with another design.

38
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:33.609
Eckhart Spalding: And the the mask mount. The input is going to be taken out.

39
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:44.209
Eckhart Spalding: And then we're going to replace the Irsa Odm with the Boston micro machines. I believe the one that Barnaby was just referring to at the beginning of the meeting.

40
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:55.959
Eckhart Spalding: And and then there's just some refocusing optics to replace, to accommodate that. So a lot of space will be freed up in the sort of the middle of the bench just because we're removing that initial mount.

41
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:05.990
Eckhart Spalding: Physically. The the components we want to remove from the bench are obviously the the glint box, and then we'll also have to retrieve the

42
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.910
Eckhart Spalding: Glenn computer, which I don't have a picture of

43
00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.230
that, I'm told, is right below that old spectrum graph off to the left.

44
00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:28.510
Eckhart Spalding: and we'll continue to use that glint computer for the time being for control the 2 mirrors that I mentioned in the Ir bench are the ones I've indicated here with the arrows and circles.

45
00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:40.939
Eckhart Spalding: Historically, it's been difficult to keep them aligned once they are aligned. And so we'd like to use one of these conex mounts that have their own integrated controller.

46
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:47.459
Eckhart Spalding: To to position those mirrors on. It does require a windows machine, however.

47
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:57.050
Eckhart Spalding:  yeah. So what what we would need on our end is, first of all, obviously optical lab space.

48
00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:11.239
Eckhart Spalding: And we want to run our own computers. First of all, just starting with the the old windows computer to control our pupil plane and focal plane cameras and the Boston DM,

49
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:24.120
Eckhart Spalding: we would have a need for an artificial source, for in lab tests. and then, once we're ready to reinstall on the summit. these are the additional

50
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.190
Eckhart Spalding: and

51
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:33.490
Eckhart Spalding: volumes that that we would need to accommodate controllers. So there are

52
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:43.300
Eckhart Spalding: the 2 controllers for the Conex Mounts that I mentioned to you are a couple goniometers. These integrated controllers are just these really small boxes.

53
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:56.430
Eckhart Spalding: And then a larger Pd xc. Inertial stage controller for a rotation stage. and Surya Seki, Ds. 1, 1, 2 times, 2

54
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.700
Eckhart Spalding: for translation stages on the Mount.

55
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:16.640
Barnaby Norris: Sorry to interrupt something that you might be glad to hear is the those connectics once, even though they say the Gui is only available for windows. In practice, we just control them from programs directly using the USB serial. And so that actually works fine from Linux. So you don't have to worry about making windows stuff available.

56
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:32.059
Julien Lozi: No one has demonstrated the Tps mounts can be controlled with Linux yet. So if you guys want to try, go for it. But I know the Mac team had some issues and ended up using a windows nook. I ended up just

57
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:37.869
Julien Lozi: using what they had without windows. Nuke. I know some connects.

58
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.940
Julien Lozi: and old Rotation Mount was not even visible with Linux.

59
00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.170
So

60
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:50.920
Julien Lozi: there is, there is some. Yeah. So if you want to try, go for it. But

61
00:08:51.740 --> 00:09:02.549
Barnaby Norris: there's no guarantees. According to the the website, they say it's the same command set as the conic stages we use for you know the linear and rotation stages.

62
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.500
Barnaby Norris: But maybe

63
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:11.519
Barnaby Norris: let me something there, or you saying it's not so much the command set. It's actually the hardware level communication. But

64
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:18.980
Julien Lozi: II don't know about the tpt. It's just that no one tried. We ended up just using the windows computer for that.

65
00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:23.280
Barnaby Norris: Right? Okay, well, that's I'll note that as something we need to follow up.

66
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:30.979
Eckhart Spalding: Okay, thank you, Barnaby. and I think this might be.

67
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:48.210
Eckhart Spalding: this might be my last slides. So this is just a series of questions we can get to these in a moment. But first of all, II just like to get a sense from the schedio folks. How feasible this plan is! What what do they think of it, as I've explained it so far.

68
00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:58.100
Julien Lozi: so there is a lot of different points. first of all, let's go back to first slide.

69
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.079
Julien Lozi: Oh, I mean, yes, this one. So

70
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:14.320
Julien Lozi:  okay. So October 20, sixth is not

71
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:15.540
Julien Lozi: available

72
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:21.460
Julien Lozi: for your test cause. It's not a Skxo engineering night.

73
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.929
Julien Lozi: So it would be only October 20. Third, the first half.

74
00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.180
Eckhart Spalding: Okay.

75
00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:33.029
Julien Lozi: in November 2 and 3. That's fine.

76
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.040
Julien Lozi: November 18 is also not a scaxo night.

77
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:48.750
Eckhart Spalding: Okay? I was thinking that maybe if it's like an A. 188 and engineering night, or something like that, that there might be some possibility figure back. But if if not. That's fine.

78
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:56.369
Julien Lozi: So these 2 nights, I think, Ninefold, we're from central nights, and we need

79
00:10:56.810 --> 00:11:04.180
Julien Lozi: the infrared light to go to carries for a characterization of the sensor. So yeah, that's not possible.

80
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:15.010
Julien Lozi: There is also some rich engineering, but in that case they are doing cabin rich also, which is not compatible with cleans. But anyway. So

81
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:21.350
Julien Lozi: yeah, so there's only yeah. October 20, third, the first half, and then November

82
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:27.640
Julien Lozi: 2 and 3, first half where you could potentially take data.

83
00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:34.530
Julien Lozi: I mean to me, this is a very ambitious plan.

84
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:43.170
Barnaby Norris:  I think context is this is definitely this is ambitious. And this is the like, you know

85
00:11:43.200 --> 00:12:08.870
Barnaby Norris: the the, the plan. A one key thing we need to do because there's so you know. Obviously, there's lots of like supporting runs and stuff like all the shaded stuff. Getting one of the key goals. In fact, the really key goal is to get it on the bench. So we can actually get, you know, the software and stuff set up cause we wanna actually be able to do tests and things. So even if it doesn't work out to do on sky nights on those nights, that's you know

86
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:17.949
Barnaby Norris: that that's okay. The. The the main thing is to get it on the bench at a hardware level. So then, you know, remotely, in the day we can do lab experiments with it.

87
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:21.179
Julien Lozi: Okay,

88
00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.480
Julien Lozi: yes.

89
00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.879
Julien Lozi: So if I look at the calendar, there is a training on the 18

90
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.280
Julien Lozi: October 18,

91
00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:36.680
Julien Lozi: and so ideally, I would want to see clean back

92
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.829
Julien Lozi: before that

93
00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:49.040
Julien Lozi: before craning women who observe on the 20 third. So yeah. think

94
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:56.459
Julien Lozi: craning back on the instrument under 16 or 17 would be the best option.

95
00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:05.499
Julien Lozi:  so that gives you like 10 days right? Something like that.

96
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.299
Julien Lozi:  So if you keep going in the slides

97
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:16.810
Julien Lozi: had more comments

98
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:29.510
Julien Lozi:  So can you go back 1 s. So the

99
00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:34.180
Julien Lozi: why? Why, you guys removing the alignment mount for the mask, you don't need that.

100
00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:41.009
Eckhart Spalding: Oh, so so the that mask is integrated onto the

101
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.270
Eckhart Spalding: onto the Mla. That's just upstream of the chip.

102
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:48.410
Julien Lozi: Oh, okay, there is no mask any more. It's

103
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:51.189
Julien Lozi: just the periscope lens.

104
00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.020
Julien Lozi: Right? Okay.

105
00:13:53.740 --> 00:14:06.799
Barnaby Norris: yeah, it's gonna make whole step of alignment. So the the the mark lens array actually is printed onto a substrate that has a being lithography mask calls on it.

106
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:18.480
Barnaby Norris: so that should. So it actually don't need that pupil plane. But the reimaging optics is too hard to change right now. So it just has a random, empty pupil plane with a mask is just because

107
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.250
Julien Lozi: yes.

108
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:28.040
Julien Lozi: And so what's what's wrong with the the Picomoro mounts that you have right now.

109
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.280
Barnaby Norris: They don't, because they're open loop.

110
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:40.739
Barnaby Norris: They don't have any repeat ability. So it's R. Makes it really hard to align. Even if you can look at a camera and sort of see it move around. There's no.

111
00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:50.270
Barnaby Norris: But they're basically the step size is somewhat random, because they're just like a stick slip thing. So the step size. When you press, move a thousand steps it's a factor of 2 randomness on it.

112
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:54.310
Barnaby Norris: So we need to close. We need to replace with closed loop mounts.

113
00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:55.220
Julien Lozi: Okay?

114
00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:57.740
Julien Lozi: Yeah. Okay.

115
00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:06.380
Julien Lozi: Yeah. What I'm the most curious about is that chain man for the

116
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.429
Julien Lozi: for the chip

117
00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:18.429
Barnaby Norris: that's been eckard and Steph have been immersed in that for the last few weeks or months.

118
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:28.390
Barnaby Norris: doing every possible trade study and optimization of everything. So that's why it's a combination of 3 manufacturers. It's a

119
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:45.259
Barnaby Norris: it was very hard to actually find things that went to spec that we needed and was super stable and fitted. So that's I'm sure, Stephan, and Eckart could probably give you a a long 3 h presentation on that.

120
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:48.019
Eckhart Spalding: The the perpetrator is mostly Steph.

121
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.030
Julien Lozi: Well, do you have a slide detailing a bit more what you guys have there

122
00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:56.110
Eckhart Spalding: for the mount?

123
00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:01.200
Eckhart Spalding: Don't. Let's see, I don't have that in a slide

124
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.309
Eckhart Spalding: def. And I have a CAD drawing.

125
00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:09.120
Eckhart Spalding: Ii can try starting it up, and that might take me a minute, though.

126
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.669
Barnaby Norris: I mean, what about that? Pdf, that I think

127
00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:17.630
Barnaby Norris: you had on slack? They just had some screenshots from

128
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:45.780
Barnaby Norris: just to fill in Julian on on basic. What's going on is one of the main things right big. One of the biggest problems right now, with all of glint, is the alignment stability. Right? That's the single biggest issue we have. And those stages we have suck they're not. They're mounted on their side, and they're spring loaded. And so what we've got here is, first of all, it's grav. The gravity vector goes down now. So there's a bracket which you can't see. That is the right angle bracket. So it's actually, you know, mounted the right way up, which is a rather nice improvement.

129
00:16:45.780 --> 00:17:08.460
Barnaby Norris: the and so the back there it looks like there's lots of stuff there, almost everything you're seeing there behind. It is just a single Thor labs travel, Max. Stage. The reason it's that big is the only one they make with good enough repeatability is also a 10 travel which we don't need. So that's actually all one thing. And then you'll see when we get the new Pdf.

130
00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:36.319
Barnaby Norris: the other stages. There are just translation, and rotation. And those top, the other things actually goniometers. And so what they are is you've got the center of rotation is the center of the micro lens array so previously. Well, we couldn't actually tip tilt them, which is one of the biggest issues, cause you couldn't make the micro lens flats to the wave front coming in. So you always had the a path offset. But also, what's nice is the goniometers the center of rotation instead of microlens array so you can add tip or tilt.

131
00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.180
Barnaby Norris: and it doesn't change the path lengths. That.

132
00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:42.800
Julien Lozi: Okay?

133
00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:51.100
Vincent Deo: Sorry when when you said, there's a bracket. And it's the gravity vector, is the right way. What do you mean?

134
00:17:51.510 --> 00:18:16.560
Barnaby Norris: So the stages really want to be put the right way up right? So, in other words, on the screen there, you know, vertical on the screen is towards the sky. The way they are right now, because the breadboards mounted sideways right the way it is right now is they come out of the screen towards us. So all the way pulls downwards, and the stages aren't meant to operate that way. So they sag, and they're non repeatable

135
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:24.480
Barnaby Norris: and stuff like that. So now it's actually mounted the way up that you know. Got intended.

136
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:36.800
Vincent Deo: Okay, but the the backing plates, the main board is still vertical on the screen. What you don't see there? Yeah, it's not on the cat drawing, but just down the bottom. There is just a regular right angle, you know, aluminium bracket

137
00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.330
Vincent Deo: right on. Yeah. Okay.

138
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:46.000
Barnaby Norris: so so def or echo, maybe. Do you want to talk through the different components? There?

139
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:56.359
Barnaby Norris: Yeah, I'm happy to. Oh, the screenshot. Sorry. I just realized the screenshot. A couple of showing that's got. Yeah, that's the travel, Max. But you found the we're actually liking the Kx.

140
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.629
Barnaby Norris: whatever it is. Xy stage.

141
00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.160
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: I think the screenshot he was showing was

142
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:15.719
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: travel. Max was even bigger than the screenshot. But yeah, the one that's in here is I think the Kx or the which is, they're both of similar size.

143
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:20.179
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: but yeah. So the the top 2. So I guess

144
00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:28.339
Barnaby Norris: I don't have a cursor, do I? Can I somehow annotate? Yeah, if if you go to view options at the top, there's a hidden annotate thing. Yep.

145
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:38.690
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: So those 2 that I've circled this 2 goniometers there, which, as Bonnie said, they are the point at which they rotate, exactly aligns with the face of the chip.

146
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:43.729
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: So that and those are responsible for I think it was role. And

147
00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:58.159
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: yo your I can't remember. And then this one below it. That's the rotation stage. So the top 2 goniometers. They're from Newport, their connects ones, and they have their own controllers. And then the rotation stage is from 4 labs.

148
00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.179
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: and then we have

149
00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:12.440
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: a Xy stage. And so these are all so 1 one would be left and right, and then the other would be into and out of the page.

150
00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.810
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: and then right behind it.

151
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:28.570
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: which it's you know, there's a at the bottom. There's a little 90 degree bracket which mounts to the thing that's behind it, and that's just another translation stage, but it acts as a Z stage. So it moves up and down.

152
00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.440
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: So it's just a

153
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:45.140
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: and and so the things that have their own controllers at the rotation stage, the XY stage and the translation stage at the back that they're ones that we need controllers for separately. But the 2 going orbiters have their own controllers

154
00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.119
Julien Lozi: on on this figure, like the

155
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:58.690
Julien Lozi: the the chip is not attached to the no, so I have to. I guess II have to create little

156
00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:03.180
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: Brackets that will attach the goniometer to the chip, mounts

157
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.060
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: to the the little rectangular box up here.

158
00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:11.059
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: So that's the next step is just building these and solidworks and getting them made

159
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:12.410
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: in lab.

160
00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.800
Julien Lozi: and is the golden middle gonna be fine with the

161
00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:22.009
Julien Lozi: the counterle of the chip like? It's very

162
00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.490
Julien Lozi: December.

163
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:39.419
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: Yes, so I have asked Newport about that, and like what moment it can hold. So the journey orders can only hold about 2 to 3 Newtons. But it's more so the the moment on it that we're concerned about, because if it

164
00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:52.530
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: if it can't handle that kind of moment, then we'd put account to wait on it. So we just need to make sure that the bracket itself is light enough. Otherwise one we could take away agony ominous. That's responsible for role, because that's

165
00:21:52.540 --> 00:22:03.790
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: of all the 5, the 6 axes that's the one that is least important. So if we were worried about for example, the bottom goniometer, because it can only hold 2 to 3 Newton's. If we're worried about

166
00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:11.459
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: whether that's going to move, you could take away the top one which would be responsible for role. So then it can hold a little bit more.

167
00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:22.659
Barnaby Norris: To add what Steph said. There! All of the other stages got very accurate angular compliance, like moment compliance, calculations

168
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:49.139
Barnaby Norris: that Stephan Eckhard have done. And so they're all in this, based on the static load. They're all less than about 5 micro Radians. Which is, you know, an order of magnitude better than we need. Yeah, as Steph said, the Conex ones she hasn't gotten like Newport haven't given a good answer. However, the moment on it is is 10 to the minus 2 Newton meters. So if if it's not counterweight, because the chip is only 78 gram, the chip, and all. That is only 78 grams. So

169
00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:53.749
Barnaby Norris: it's worst case scenario, as Steph said. You just need to have a 78 gram

170
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:58.260
Barnaby Norris: piece of metal on the other side, which is fine. You'd just be integrated into the bracket.

171
00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:05.699
Julien Lozi: Okay? So why do you need to motorize these rotations.

172
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:21.409
Barnaby Norris: So that big challenge is you've got you need the front of the chip to be exactly playing to the the incoming wave. To

173
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:43.989
Barnaby Norris: what do we work out? I mean, it's gotta. It's gotta be about 1 one hundredth of a wave times the distance of like, what was the separation Mark lens, or a the 120 microns. So it worked out to be that whatever it was, the angular tolerance is really really fine. So in what we had previously, you might remember, there's this little thumb screws.

174
00:23:43.990 --> 00:24:03.650
Barnaby Norris: And basically they're impossible. Because the first problem is, you can't motorize them so you can't actually scan it. Which is the most important thing. Secondly, the center of rotation isn't actually the center of the micro lens array so, in fact, they mostly do translation, so I don't know if you remember. In. So, for example, Mark Antoine's paper.

175
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.490
Barnaby Norris: you probably don't remember, but it had the

176
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:18.120
Barnaby Norris: the re. You couldn't get to the white light fringe in a lot of places, or you could only get to one at a time. So basically, you need to get it within good enough that then the mems segment piston amount.

177
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:21.620
Barnaby Norris: Can take up the slack without using up all its stroke.

178
00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:32.499
Barnaby Norris: And so basically, what we're gonna do is have a sort of optimization routine. Left, right up down. Isn't that critical? That's only gonna be good to like a couple of microns.

179
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:56.639
Barnaby Norris: And then the the the role isn't that critical cause? That's just getting the sub apertures in the right place. That's only gotta be good to come out of what that'll like. Avoid a a degree or something. It's it wasn't very fine at all. And then the really fine stuff is the pitch and yaw because that is what basically, that's the first order fringe tracker. It's it's setting the

180
00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:18.080
Barnaby Norris: the the wavefront flap. So I imagine the way it'll work is when we do the alignment. Probably the translation and everything will be pro set. Once, you know, we optimize that once, and then the things that are done actively. When we wanna do, an optimization is flatten. The mems, do the your pitch

181
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.250
Barnaby Norris: scan. Then do the mem, scan.

182
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:40.420
Barnaby Norris: Also those things that look like they prude off the right. They're flexible cables. It's just the way the had models are. So what this means is there'll be nothing sticking out like there is right now. So all of that weird stuff sticking out on the right, which has to be that will all be gone.

183
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:45.970
Julien Lozi: Okay.

184
00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:49.470
Julien Lozi: for the schedule.

185
00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:54.609
Julien Lozi: So you mention in the first slide, or one of the slides

186
00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.150
Julien Lozi: that you guys were planning to arrive

187
00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.780
Julien Lozi: around the 6. So can.

188
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:06.520
Barnaby Norris: That's nominal.

189
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.540
Eckhart Spalding: Yeah.

190
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:11.580
Julien Lozi: Well, nominally like the

191
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.860
Julien Lozi: we stop observing on the 20 ninth of September

192
00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.619
Julien Lozi: place that we can

193
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.470
Julien Lozi: 30 and October first.

194
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:28.590
Julien Lozi: like the prime is okay. If you arrive on October sixth, this is a Friday.

195
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:36.750
Julien Lozi: So you're not gonna going to a summit until the Monday, October 9, which gives you only

196
00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:42.070
Julien Lozi: technically like one week pretty much

197
00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.609
Julien Lozi: before you have to bring it back up to the summit.

198
00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:55.619
Barnaby Norris: That's a good point, Friday, so coming earlier would actually make sense. And so maybe that means that Steph just comes a bit later or something.

199
00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:01.320
Julien Lozi: Are you waiting for stuff to arrive. What was the the

200
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:10.610
Julien Lozi: Stephen? Stephen?

201
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.559
Julien Lozi: Yeah, it's not important.

202
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:19.009
Vincent Deo: But yeah. But as Joao was saying, you can't really come earlier, because we're observing.

203
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.779
Julien Lozi: No, no, we we we finish observing

204
00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.899
Vincent Deo: the 20 ninth of September. So

205
00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:33.200
Julien Lozi: like we can start submit work on the October second. Are we training? When are we training?

206
00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:34.870
Julien Lozi: 18?

207
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:38.749
Vincent Deo: And we're not craning at the end of the run on the 20 on the thirtieth?

208
00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:47.430
Julien Lozi: No, we're training. On the 27, the night of the 29 is the L. The Lgs ilcs. 9.

209
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:51.110
Vincent Deo: So the earliest day we can pop glint is the 27 s.

210
00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:54.380
Julien Lozi: Yeah. But no.

211
00:27:54.680 --> 00:28:01.099
Vincent Deo: oh, just saying, just just, you know, lining up, just lining up the constraints

212
00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:09.930
Julien Lozi: will start on October second at the late, the earliest.

213
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:12.039
Barnaby Norris: Wait you on a weekend.

214
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.170
Barnaby Norris: Yes.

215
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:21.109
Barnaby Norris: So that's a good point coming early would basically give them a whole extra week. That's actually a really good point.

216
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:29.079
Julien Lozi: Yes, yeah. I mean, you know, even if you don't have everything like you probably have enough stuff to

217
00:28:29.670 --> 00:28:36.719
Barnaby Norris: to start the work. Yup. So then maybe the best thing is that if me and Eckart come, and then Steph comes after her graduation.

218
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:43.420
Julien Lozi: Yeah, I mean, what's more important, graduating or or Clint?

219
00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.009
Barnaby Norris: Yes, Def.

220
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:56.079
Stephanie Rossini-Bryson: you guys could do a ceremony. I'm sure you gotta.

221
00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:59.020
Peter Tuthill: I don't know. You got a gown over there

222
00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:13.279
Barnaby Norris: really cool. I saw we don't have defenses in Australia for Phd. I think we're going to, but also I've been to couple in Hawaii and like, for example, Shawn Goebel's one, and it's really cool cause afterwards, when they give you, doctor, like you get overlays, which is really cool.

223
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:14.650
Julien Lozi: Yep.

224
00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:21.349
Eckhart Spalding: hmm! So if if I understand this right, if Summit work were to start on October second

225
00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:26.270
Eckhart Spalding: would would craning be October second or third? Is that right?

226
00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:35.600
Julien Lozi: I'm I'm just saying, like we can remove glean from Scaxale the week of October second

227
00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:42.050
Julien Lozi: can be any time that week. But if you guys arrive on Friday, then we can't work until the next Monday.

228
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:43.900
Julien Lozi: So

229
00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:48.229
Julien Lozi: yeah, you don't have to to show up on the first or the second like

230
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:58.360
Julien Lozi: depends how much time you need really like. This is. I can't really tell you how much time you need, but if you arrive on the sixth, then you can list on the ninth.

231
00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:11.050
Julien Lozi: bring it down and start walking the lab on the tent. you know. So that that already limiting you. Yup. So yeah, that's that's just yeah.

232
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:17.089
Barnaby Norris: It's a very good point. Yeah, it's probably better to have people show up early and

233
00:30:17.390 --> 00:30:19.460
Julien Lozi: starts removing stuff

234
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:22.690
Barnaby Norris: the other issue is lab space.

235
00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.890
Julien Lozi: we don't have lap space at the moment.

236
00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:34.200
Julien Lozi:  the in the SIM lab. We have the the hard booth and the soft booth.

237
00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.780
Julien Lozi: The hard booth is used

238
00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:42.010
Julien Lozi: by our different projects, and this

239
00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:55.390
Julien Lozi: already not enough space. and the soft booth is used by the L. Tio project so. But we could put you in the old

240
00:30:56.030 --> 00:31:00.860
Julien Lozi: A. Waini lab. I think, if we clean up a bit of that table

241
00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:04.749
Julien Lozi: like your bench is not huge. So that should be okay.

242
00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:10.620
Barnaby Norris: Is that is that the like electronics? You want to the right of the entry way. Yeah, cool.

243
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:14.890
Eckhart Spalding: Okay, that's good. The old a 1. 88 lab.

244
00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:26.749
Julien Lozi: Yeah. So there's a there's a another har booth with an old zygo in there that they used for characterizing the the Iwiti. DM,

245
00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:33.539
Julien Lozi: the only annoying thing about this one is the the table is imperial and not metric.

246
00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:40.659
Barnaby Norris: Yeah, like you only have. You have a bread bowl. So it's probably fine.

247
00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:42.420
Julien Lozi: Oh.

248
00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:48.569
Julien Lozi: yeah, we just need to ask them if it's fine and and can make some space, but

249
00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:52.120
Barnaby Norris: should be awesome. That's that's great.

250
00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:53.160
Eckhart Spalding: Okay?

251
00:31:53.690 --> 00:32:02.999
Barnaby Norris: One thing I want to ask about is we can. Otherwise we can probably get something you don't have a broadband source

252
00:32:03.650 --> 00:32:08.529
Barnaby Norris: available, do you? I'm imagining you've got a super K, but cones using that one. I think

253
00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.960
Barnaby Norris: the is that right?

254
00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:12.810
Julien Lozi: So we have

255
00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:17.550
Julien Lozi: the new super K that we're using in the SIM lab right now

256
00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:18.969
Julien Lozi: in here.

257
00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.479
Barnaby Norris: Is it something we could borrow as that currently being used in an experiment.

258
00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:31.230
Julien Lozi:  I mean, it's used by by hyun. But

259
00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.690
Julien Lozi: hopefully, Johan's stuff is gonna be at the summit.

260
00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.990
Julien Lozi: although it seems unlikely now. But

261
00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:47.620
Kyohoon Ahn: oh, yeah, I think October should be fine.

262
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:49.090
Barnaby Norris: Okay, cool.

263
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:52.869
Kyohoon Ahn: It's hard to tell. It's in review process.

264
00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:54.770
Kyohoon Ahn: Hello, Hello!

265
00:32:55.710 --> 00:33:00.680
Kyohoon Ahn: Sorry now. I cannot tell yet. But yeah, you can borrow. We can share the line.

266
00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.079
Barnaby Norris: But the problem is, there's faith.

267
00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:05.229
Space is not enough.

268
00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:13.239
Julien Lozi: Oh, like we would have to move the source given. So oh, I see, this is the kind of sharing where you don't

269
00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.190
Julien Lozi: really share. You give them the source for a bit.

270
00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.799
Kyohoon Ahn: Okay, it is what it is.

271
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:27.920
Julien Lozi: I mean, technically, you know, it's a week like, you guys probably just need to stop with a red laser for for a while. And then

272
00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:31.140
Julien Lozi: that's right. Only used a super. Caddian.

273
00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.600
Kyohoon Ahn: Yeah, then I should be fine.

274
00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:46.690
Barnaby Norris: That would be great. Kun is in the soft booth. I'm trying to remember, because where you've got the nonlinear curvature, wavefront sensor set up. Is there any space in that table?

275
00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.459
Barnaby Norris: I know you've moved that upstairs, haven't you?

276
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:55.460
Kyohoon Ahn: No, it's I mean, yeah. It's in not the soft booze, so

277
00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:00.410
Kyohoon Ahn: is being used by the Lto

278
00:34:00.810 --> 00:34:12.110
Kyohoon Ahn: test. So they are like huge. There is very huge system in the software, so there is no space in crowded as well.

279
00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.670
Barnaby Norris: Yeah, okay, yes, right?

280
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:21.350
Kyohoon Ahn: I mean, you guys can have the space below my setup because my setup is kind of second floor.

281
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:23.829
Kyohoon Ahn: But I'm I'm not sure how

282
00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.019
Kyohoon Ahn: big year set up. Ease

283
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:33.479
Barnaby Norris: it. It sounds like it might be easier if we can use the A. 188 bench. That sounds like it'd be less in people's way and things

284
00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:41.950
Vincent Deo: the solution, Julia, but that's hypothetical. Is that we

285
00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:47.599
Vincent Deo: stash. Does I go away to liberate some room, but I don't know how much of a pain that is

286
00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.489
Julien Lozi: big one.

287
00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:51.460
Vincent Deo: Yeah.

288
00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:57.690
Julien Lozi: it'd be easier to just clean the. But you know, it's just that

289
00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:05.460
Vincent Deo: that gives room in the hard boost. So that doesn't hinder Kyoon engine and blue for a week or 2.

290
00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:11.330
Eckhart Spalding: But

291
00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:34.140
Barnaby Norris: and the former. So

292
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:37.529
Julien Lozi: there are only 6 people in there. It's insane.

293
00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:43.140
Barnaby Norris: Now that that sounds good is definitely the better way to go

294
00:35:43.290 --> 00:35:44.180
Barnaby Norris: awesome.

295
00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:50.420
Eckhart Spalding: Okay? Also, what do hard booth and soft booth mean in this context.

296
00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:56.309
Julien Lozi: abuses just hard walls and soft booses like the plastic key

297
00:35:57.070 --> 00:36:01.680
Julien Lozi: panels that so they're not really clean like.

298
00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:05.040
Julien Lozi: Don't expect a clean room level, but

299
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:10.100
Julien Lozi:  The harbus would be a little cleaner than the south booths.

300
00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:20.250
Julien Lozi: But yeah, we have ventilation and stuff like that. But we can tell now if you care about cleanliness. But I mean, this is just green cell

301
00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:28.109
Julien Lozi: like it's gonna end up at the summit with which is not clean. So

302
00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:35.830
Barnaby Norris: so I wanted to ask Vince and Olivier mostly about computer things. So

303
00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:54.580
Barnaby Norris: it sounds like, briefly mentioned it to Olivia yesterday. The easiest thing for now is probably cause we've got that little small form factor PC, that we use right now and nuke that and put Linux on it? And because all we, what we need to run on that is moving the stages.

304
00:36:54.600 --> 00:37:00.739
Barnaby Norris: And then also the most important thing is the DMO cune the the DM. That

305
00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:08.589
Barnaby Norris: the the Boston micro machines, one that goes into Glynn. Do I know you're using it? Do you recall if it's Pcie or USB.

306
00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:10.640
Kyohoon Ahn: Oh, yes.

307
00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:16.170
Barnaby Norris: cool. Okay, great. Yeah. It's the fast driver. Great. Okay? So so

308
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.580
Vincent Deo: I can keep accommodating your cigarette, too.

309
00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:27.920
Barnaby Norris: And I can accommodate your men. So we're not gonna need to use the C red 2, because we'll use well, at least, the the main thing is using up upon a

310
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:35.550
Vincent Deo: okay, that's so that that makes things easier. I think we what happens to your spectrograph, then?

311
00:37:35.560 --> 00:38:03.500
Barnaby Norris: So the idea is, yeah, I mean, one option is that, you know we we actually bring it back to Sydney to use for lab tests. It's from a previous conversation with Ollie. It sounds like it's good to keep there as a backup, especially because, you know, sometimes the C red one might be on and if we wanna do daytime tests or something. Then we've got the option of also for the phoneic lantern work. We have the option of, you know, swapping things around. So I think, for now we leave it there, but it won't be in

312
00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:04.790
Barnaby Norris: primary use.

313
00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:11.880
Barnaby Norris: How do you connect to Upperpani? That was the next thing I had to ask you about so

314
00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:21.669
Barnaby Norris: before. Just briefly, before we move on to that so, Vince, do you reckon you could actually accommodate the DM in one of the machines?

315
00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:25.890
Vincent Deo: Yeah, that's that's that's not a problem. So in that case, I think

316
00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:47.739
Barnaby Norris: I mean the reason I mean to start off with, we'd probably, you know, for setting up in the lab in Hilo would use our own little box. But we really want to be able to do exactly what you're saying, because the idea is at some stage. We, you know, we have the active fringe tracking, right? So we need to do like real time loop from up upon a feeding back to the DM. Somehow. So you know, if that card is in one of the schesia machines, that's obviously

317
00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.590
Barnaby Norris: much much easier.

318
00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:58.409
Vincent Deo: Yeah, not a problem at all. Excellent. Excellent. So yeah, so, Julian, the

319
00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:19.170
Barnaby Norris: what you know, there's the I know we origin like there's that sort of design for the the later chip, the the Higher Wave Guide, Count Chip, and you know we you got that nice quote with the stacked V group thing, this chip here. This doesn't have so many output, so we can just use a regular V groove. So what I wanted to ask is, you know, up upon a so there's those little, you know.

320
00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:31.990
Barnaby Norris: places that you can put a V groove down from a metal block so we can make those little rectangle so we can make the right sort of connector that goes in those. So I guess we just need know the

321
00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:33.800
Barnaby Norris: dimensions. There.

322
00:39:34.530 --> 00:39:36.980
Julien Lozi: You already have a V groove.

323
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:42.139
Barnaby Norris: Simon does. Yeah. Oh, we don't need, I mean, unless you've got another preference.

324
00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:46.410
Julien Lozi: No, I'm I'm running out of space for the the

325
00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:55.159
Barnaby Norris: the round slots. So, using a rectangular slot would be better if you can. Rectangular slots suits us better as well. So that's good.

326
00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:58.439
Julien Lozi: Okay? So yeah, I'll send you

327
00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:03.450
Barnaby Norris: the dimensions, I guess. Excellent. And then, yeah, the

328
00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:04.830
Julien Lozi: okay.

329
00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:11.729
Julien Lozi: So what do you? What do you you don't have right now.

330
00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:14.689
Julien Lozi: in all of this

331
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:28.000
Barnaby Norris: most of these parts we were. Gonna they're all in stock ones and get them sent directly to halo. So once, you know, once we've got a sort of a plan, and you know, if everyone's okay in stuff, we just press the buttons and get them sent.

332
00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:34.100
Eckhart Spalding: Yeah, they're they're some of the off the shelf optics and the current clin. We're just going to reuse.

333
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:41.570
Julien Lozi: Yeah. But so what's not ordered yet.

334
00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:48.740
Barnaby Norris: It's ordered because we want to have it shipped to you, and you wanted to talk to you before we started

335
00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.260
Barnaby Norris: doing that.

336
00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:57.180
Vincent Deo: Yes, since we're on the stages I didn't comment earlier, but in terms of Linux control.

337
00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:00.099
Vincent Deo: I want to say, challenge accepted.

338
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:05.310
Vincent Deo: And Julian, do we have all the USB hub space we need?

339
00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:12.359
Vincent Deo: Or you guys are gonna provide more hubs. Can you guys get hubs. I got a hub guy

340
00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:17.000
Vincent Deo: top top grade. Can you guys provision a raspberry pi and be standalone?

341
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.659
Barnaby Norris: What do you want to, Russell? But why? Oh.

342
00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:24.660
Julien Lozi: why, like the the muddles? Why, why can't we just

343
00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:32.990
Vincent Deo: have a glint computer controlling those models? That's Yup, the nuke, or yeah, or raspberry? That's exactly what I meant.

344
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:37.550
Barnaby Norris: Oh, but you have. You have a PC, you have a full PC, just for you.

345
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:50.620
Barnaby Norris: Yeah, we thought like it. It's like a little small form factor thing that we need to find a place to. I was I was skipping on that because since we're gonna have your camera on your DM, you don't need a PC, so

346
00:41:50.860 --> 00:42:16.529
Barnaby Norris: we, I think we definitely want to at some stage. Yeah. And and if I mean, if we can use the machines. And yeah, we can certainly get a raspberry pi or something that's obviously a lot easier and integrated. And the software stack is much easier. And we don't have to like say, Hey, we share files of Smb, whatever the hell we had to do before.

347
00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:22.739
Olivier Guyon: so do you? I guess the question is, do you have software alignment software that needs simultaneously

348
00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:29.230
Olivier Guyon: to talk to stages and have a fairly low latency access to the DM.

349
00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:34.089
Olivier Guyon: And the camera? Because if you have your own computer that talks to stages. But the camera

350
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:53.469
Barnaby Norris: and the DM are on our computers. How do you know? Then we need to plan a little bit ahead. Yeah, I know that that would be suboptimal, like, yes. So we do need that. So we'd have to set some sort of network connection to send commands. It always be a lot easier if we can. Just, you know, if they're locally connected. So we can just write straight to the serial ports.

351
00:42:54.680 --> 00:43:00.139
Olivier Guyon: So so your plan is is, you guys

352
00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:08.230
Barnaby Norris: like, you guys don't need kilohertz control of the model site. You're fine.

353
00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:21.450
Barnaby Norris: Yeah. It's it's more of a, I guess, just in terms of simplicity for software stack and things. If all the other computer is doing is plugging into like a few controllers, a few stage controllers. It's probably easier.

354
00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:33.109
Barnaby Norris: especially from a software point of view, rather than having a network connection to a computer that all it does is send commands. If it's possible just to plug those usbs into the same computer that's running the software that does. DM, and what not.

355
00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:45.299
Vincent Deo: Yeah, that's that's what. Yes. Sorry I had disconnected that. You had a full computer for you guys. And that's fine so you're saying mini atx. But that's gonna go on the frame, right?

356
00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:51.550
Barnaby Norris: It have yeah, somewhere on the frame. It's another thing, the other reason using

357
00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:54.550
Eckhart Spalding: well, which is

358
00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:58.010
Vincent Deo: sorry. The Skixio support frame like the the

359
00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.720
Vincent Deo: bench frame.

360
00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:03.369
Vincent Deo: This is this is crowded.

361
00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:08.529
Julien Lozi: I mean, I would prefer like, if you can get a a small nuke, or

362
00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:14.649
Julien Lozi: something else like even smaller than

363
00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:21.930
Barnaby Norris: yeah. If we don't need to have the Pcie card, then obviously we don't need a the small form factor.

364
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:24.390
Barnaby Norris: if if but it may be worth

365
00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:35.300
Barnaby Norris: the proper way. If Vince, if it sounds like Vince, is cool with this, if we don't actually have a separate computer, because all the computer would be doing is sending commands to stages, and if we do need another supply

366
00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:41.289
Julien Lozi: there is no space. There is no USB port available. We already have, like a hundred USB ports

367
00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:45.219
Julien Lozi: taken, maybe not a hundred. But we're getting close to that. So.

368
00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:48.289
Vincent Deo: so that's the thing. It's mostly about USB, space.

369
00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:59.299
Vincent Deo:  so yeah, raspberry pi or something. Well, if if you can actually fit that on like one mini atx in a very small casing.

370
00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:03.160
Vincent Deo: so a mini atx motherboard is 6 inches by 6 inches. Sure.

371
00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:05.170
Vincent Deo: I mean.

372
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:20.700
Vincent Deo: we have it in a case with power supply and everything. But I'd much rather just buy a raspberry pi or something, because it's exactly so. If if you can accommodate that on yeah, like one respo thing

373
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:27.490
Barnaby Norris: plus power supply plus one USB. Hub, that that would save a lot of space for us, and and that would be great.

374
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:37.209
Barnaby Norris: Let's do that then. And so the we just need to make something which you maybe already have. Do you have a software stack that's like raspberry pi like an arm

375
00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:39.360
Barnaby Norris: Mini version of the

376
00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:47.420
Barnaby Norris: milk. What do you have any milk you just need. You just need your reports. That's it.

377
00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:57.400
Barnaby Norris: Oh, but to send the commands over, you know you've got those team up sessions that share across the network? Can we set up a similar team based thing on a raspberry pi to do the USB,

378
00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:03.650
Barnaby Norris: yeah, cool. You know, you can install Linux on your raspberry pi. What do you mean? It's only Linux.

379
00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:12.150
Vincent Deo: isn't it? No, but like like ubuntu ubuntu on the raspberry, pi

380
00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:24.300
Vincent Deo: the put put boot to our your pi, and it'll be fine and then there's there's plenty of network protocols or bare Ssh. Calls to to get to the mounts

381
00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:30.660
from the exterior into your pie, and from your pie out to your DM, on 605.

382
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:32.320
Barnaby Norris: Now.

383
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:36.320
Vincent Deo: now, if you bring in, it's gonna be

384
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:40.299
Vincent Deo: literally mounts. Only like it's not gonna give you a workspace.

385
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:47.920
Vincent Deo: You can have another computer somewhere, not on the badge to have a little workspace of yours to do stuff.

386
00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.839
Vincent Deo: but then can be on the frame.

387
00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:57.020
Barnaby Norris: I think, what? What will be good? Actually. So I think what you we should definitely do that like longer term.

388
00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:21.779
Barnaby Norris: because we want to work in the lab in halo. So we'll probably use our little computer for that. And we wanna have the Pcie card in there for the DM, I think the first iteration is actually, we should just use our own little computer, and we'll figure out how to put it somewhere. Because that way we can get everything working in the lab right in halo, because we'll have the DM. And stuff there. But if it's Linux and a bun to is probably pretty painless.

389
00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:27.380
Barnaby Norris: Famous last words to move the serial port control bit onto a mini, a mini computer.

390
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:31.120
Vincent Deo: Yeah, that's so. That's basically

391
00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:36.969
Vincent Deo: what what Julian did for the infrared permit. All the hardware of the infrared permit runs on the single pie with Ukuntu.

392
00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:46.569
Barnaby Norris: So we'll start off with the DM. Not connected in Scaxo. We'll just put in our Mini, PC, so then we can cause wanna run it in helo

393
00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:54.680
Barnaby Norris: and we can keep that at first and then get rid of the small form factor. Eventually.

394
00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.400
Vincent Deo: Oh, yeah.

395
00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:25.180
Barnaby Norris: yeah. If you can. If you can switch your PC to the absolute minimum size around the motherboard. Then we can probably fit that. You've asked the right person cause. I've just been spending a lot of time trying to get the ultimate small fact to small form factor gaming. PC, and I've got this one from Dan Labs, and it's so small that the so the Gpu basically pushes the motherboard with a little riser. And the whole thing is like this. So

396
00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:28.960
Vincent Deo: oh, yeah, you know what you're looking for that. That's that's good.

397
00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:40.120
Barnaby Norris: It'll look sick. So the trouble is, all this stuff has heaps of RGB. Cause it's all gaming aimed which isn't great for the the bench. So after, like. burn out the Leds.

398
00:48:42.870 --> 00:48:43.680
Eckhart Spalding: yeah.

399
00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:48.330
Eckhart Spalding: do do the Skexio folks have other questions for us?

400
00:48:48.730 --> 00:49:01.729
Vincent Deo: Yeah, in the in that description we're making. Then that's assuming we get all your stages running on Linux, which should be doable. assuming we can't. What's the fallback? You keep the nuke. And that's it.

401
00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:06.850
Barnaby Norris: Yeah, I've that's really interesting that Julian mentioned that

402
00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:08.480
Barnaby Norris: the conics

403
00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:18.970
Barnaby Norris: tip tilt mirror mounts. People have had issues getting them working on windows. I'd like to know more about what sorry getting working on Linux. I'd like to know more about what the actual problems were, do you?

404
00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:29.539
Barnaby Norris: No, I have no idea, so don't know who who are the people who ran into the issue with that. Sorry, I know you said. The make team has one. But

405
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:31.960
Julien Lozi: we have, too. We could.

406
00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:42.880
Julien Lozi: We could connect one to a Linux machine. And you guys can try to work it out remotely.

407
00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:44.890
Barnaby Norris: That would be great.

408
00:49:45.100 --> 00:50:11.389
Barnaby Norris: I think, when one issue we've had and we've had. This is the linear stages, is they don't show up at all. On Linux. And you might remember, Vince, me and Adam would grilling you about this and there's a whole bunch of random you dev stuff you needed to set up to actually make them show up as a serial port. It's not some of the connect stages to show up, because they're like an Ftdi standard thing, and some of them are something weird. Maybe that's the problem the Mac team ran into. In which case we know how to fix that.

409
00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.010
Julien Lozi: Yeah.

410
00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:21.509
Barnaby Norris: yeah, that'd be great if you can plug one in to a Linux computer and then we can have a play with it that that would be great.

411
00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:25.310
Vincent Deo: So maybe maybe maybe Set could do that for us.

412
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.879
Julien Lozi: Alright. Now, huh! I heard my name.

413
00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:38.829
Vincent Deo: Well, someday, yeah. Plug some of of

414
00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:40.759
Julien Lozi: the retro P mount.

415
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:45.960
Julien Lozi: if you can plug it to A to CO. 2.

416
00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:48.890
Sebastien Vievard: Usd, okay.

417
00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.629
Julien Lozi: yes. Oh, any

418
00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:53.639
Julien Lozi: Linux machine, actually.

419
00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.780
Julien Lozi: Yes.

420
00:50:56.490 --> 00:51:00.009
Julien Lozi: And then they can't try to figure it out remotely.

421
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:03.039
Sebastien Vievard: So interest is it.

422
00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:09.380
Barnaby Norris: ish you want to put the order in. But it doesn't be today, like whenever you get a chance.

423
00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:13.740
Sebastien Vievard: So you want an IP, okay, I just need to know

424
00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:22.129
Julien Lozi: the reach. The retro IP mount. The reach is connected to connect driver nuke

425
00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:25.040
Julien Lozi: connected to the nuke.

426
00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.570
Sebastien Vievard: So this

427
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:28.769
Sebastien Vievard: the cable should be labeled.

428
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:33.829
Julien Lozi: yeah, he labeled. He's labeled.

429
00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:38.639
Sebastien Vievard: Wow, yeah, I can do that.

430
00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.789
Sebastien Vievard: Let me go check right now.

431
00:51:41.360 --> 00:52:05.139
Barnaby Norris: Oh, good! I mean. So cause said, all we wanna do is we just wanna see if we can talk to. We don't actually need to, you know, use it to do stuff. We just wanna just interface. Yeah? And and if there's any choice, the Linux machine that would be least problematic if we needed to do like, you know, u dev service restart, whatever it is that that demon, the USB demon restart, because if at some point we need to do that to get it working. Obviously, that in

432
00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:15.339
Barnaby Norris: for for a second resets all USB devices. So I wouldn't want to do thatio 2, because that would be really annoying. So I don't know if there's any machine that if we have to at some stage

433
00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:20.289
Barnaby Norris: interrupt USB devices for a second, it doesn't cause.

434
00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:25.049
Barnaby Norris: Yeah, perfect.

435
00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:27.950
Julien Lozi: Now, do you have any objections?

436
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:35.059
Barnaby Norris: Nothing. Okay. Great. I'll make sure miles is doing a measurement when we do it.

437
00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:42.220
Sebastien Vievard: Yeah, no, I ideally 605, or whatever

438
00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:48.629
Vincent Deo: in in linear distance stick to who is closest. That's why.

439
00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:50.109
Sebastien Vievard: Yeah, let's see.

440
00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:55.050
Sebastien Vievard: Okay, well, you can keep talking, and I'll try to do it now.

441
00:52:55.470 --> 00:53:03.170
Julien Lozi: Awesome. So the Gonyu manner uses uses the Conex ag. PP. Which is the same as the linear stage.

442
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:05.920
Julien Lozi: so it should be an issue.

443
00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:17.330
Barnaby Norris: But the tip tilt mount uses the Conex, a. GAP. Which is different. I probably missed that. Those are different.

444
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:20.979
Julien Lozi: Yeah, that's why, you know.

445
00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:25.039
Julien Lozi: like the I mean a long time ago

446
00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:32.689
Julien Lozi: a name board a rotation mount for filter wheel. That's another connects. That's discontinued now. But

447
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:39.270
Julien Lozi: the the previous version of that the faster connects that we use for the differential wheel.

448
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:41.929
Julien Lozi: and Darwan was not even visible

449
00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:45.240
Julien Lozi: in a Linux machine like nothing would show up.

450
00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:55.879
Barnaby Norris: I wonder if that's the cause? We had that issue with. Adam bought some for home delay which had that issue, and we did eventually fix it. But it was really hard to make it visible in Linux.

451
00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:59.050
Barnaby Norris: it might be issue.

452
00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:00.860
Julien Lozi: I don't know.

453
00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:04.400
Barnaby Norris: Yeah. Okay, well, that that's great if we can try it out.

454
00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:07.350
Barnaby Norris: I see. So kind of see

455
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:12.189
Julien Lozi: which controller uses is used by the rotation.

456
00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:14.249
Julien Lozi: He has a rotation mount. But

457
00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:24.969
Olivier Guyon: device would not show up at the lowest level

458
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:29.990
Olivier Guyon: USB device. But if you put a hub in between, it would show up under Linux.

459
00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.210
Barnaby Norris: Whoa?

460
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:37.089
Vincent Deo: Oh, yeah, that that happened to me recently, too. Some hub that would hide or show stuff.

461
00:54:39.070 --> 00:54:41.670
Barnaby Norris: How weird's as an enumeration thing.

462
00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:47.410
Vincent Deo: It's it's no, it's like, if it doesn't show up in Ls, USB, it's an electrical level problem.

463
00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:52.280
Barnaby Norris: Oh, so you'd see something not in Ls, USB, and you wouldn't see anything d message.

464
00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:58.480
Vincent Deo: That's yeah. I mean, that's that's crazy level stuff. That's it's it's the crazy layer.

465
00:54:58.530 --> 00:55:06.460
Barnaby Norris: the crazy layer that that's that part of the stack of the the USB like transport layer. Crazy layer.

466
00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:18.510
Olivier Guyon: Yeah, it's it's right below the. And it it happens more often with raspberry pi's. So we've had problems where the same device, same OS same kernel

467
00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:22.629
Olivier Guyon: shows up in in an intel nug, but doesn't show up in a raspberry pi.

468
00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:28.490
Olivier Guyon: Really, by putting a by putting a hub in between the raspberry pi and the device in touch, sure

469
00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.749
Barnaby Norris: could be a power thing, maybe

470
00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:40.690
Barnaby Norris: like it. The OS isn't allocating enough power. because the Colonel has to worry about that right. And these conex things use lots of power. And hmm.

471
00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:44.469
Barnaby Norris: and the hub just goes like I got you fam and then gives whatever.

472
00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:50.319
Barnaby Norris: Okay? Good stuff. Yeah. Oh, yeah. And and so

473
00:55:50.410 --> 00:55:56.829
Barnaby Norris: for your hub, do get one with an external power supply. Now, we'll probably get one of those.

474
00:55:56.970 --> 00:56:02.910
Barnaby Norris: I can't remember the brand. They're like the long black ones, and they got little switches and blue early Ds. D'you know the

475
00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:23.590
Barnaby Norris: make sure I get one, that if it's power cycle you need to press the button to turn it back on, because some of the hubs have that which is the worst. Yeah. So either, they're like flip flop buttons. So you're sure there's day on a while back I got 3 replacements, and they're press buttons, but I make extra sure they do stay on. If you power cycle.

476
00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.509
Vincent Deo: I can send you the bike.

477
00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:32.410
Barnaby Norris: Yeah. Yeah. I've got one here that like 20 bucks. Nothing fancy at all.

478
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:33.970
Barnaby Norris: Think? Static?

479
00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:39.960
Eckhart Spalding: II yeah, II think there's one such power supply in our office, Barnaby, on Chris's desk.

480
00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:52.040
Barnaby Norris: Yeah, we we'll we'll make a shopping list of that sort of stuff, I mean. So just takes about to reiterate. I think I mean, this sounds really good, and I think we have to like you've pointed out. You know, it's an ambitious schedule, and

481
00:56:52.190 --> 00:57:02.910
Barnaby Norris: the primary goal very much is, you know, if all goes well. This is a pretty, you know, straightforward, optical swap out right famous last words. It shouldn't be an issue. But if we don't.

482
00:57:02.910 --> 00:57:25.479
Barnaby Norris: you know, if if we run into issues, it's really really important just to even at the first part done right to get onto Skex, I/O, so then we can remotely do things on the bench, or whatever because and this is like a nice time, because there is that, you know, it's it's one of the largest gaps where you're not doing observing and whatnot. So I don't think we need to panic about the schedule. I think you know it's

483
00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:29.440
Barnaby Norris: we we we get

484
00:57:30.070 --> 00:57:33.159
Julien Lozi: like you're assuming you are getting everything

485
00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:40.620
Julien Lozi: before, like we had. We're already September twelfth. Like you.

486
00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:45.309
Julien Lozi: I want you to put back the instrument in a man's basically.

487
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.659
Barnaby Norris: Yeah, take it down and put it back

488
00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:54.989
Julien Lozi: in a month. You mean, in terms of getting stuff delivered. You're getting stuff delivered, even if they're in stock like

489
00:57:55.290 --> 00:57:57.839
Julien Lozi: it can take a few weeks just to get

490
00:57:58.410 --> 00:58:04.510
Barnaby Norris: mounts and stuff. So yeah. I mean, we've got we'd have to order them to their.

491
00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:17.049
Barnaby Norris: Yes, Steph's been keeping a track of all the lead times, and talking to him about, or shipping dates and things like that. So it's not a completely unknown quantity. But yeah, no, totally. It's it's it's very tight.

492
00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:24.580
Barnaby Norris: And we'll obviously check all this stuff and get proper dates and stuff before we make any firm, you know, commitments to

493
00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:25.580
Barnaby Norris: travel.

494
00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:31.519
Julien Lozi: but in any case, like Glint is going back on the instrument

495
00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:35.229
Julien Lozi: before the 18. So even if you get not done.

496
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:40.510
Julien Lozi: So that's that's a requirement that we have to fix.

497
00:58:40.530 --> 00:58:47.609
Barnaby Norris: Well, I mean, worst case scenario is, it doesn't go back, and it has to stay in the lab for months. Right? No, no, no, we don't.

498
00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:51.690
Julien Lozi: We don't crane back with a module missing. That's

499
00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:59.009
Julien Lozi: a a big like. It's it's you know, some weight on the side of the instrument. That's gonna change.

500
00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:03.150
Julien Lozi: I don't want any change of weight for for science purposes. Like.

501
00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:05.590
Barnaby Norris: right? Okay, so yeah.

502
00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:11.019
Julien Lozi: like an imbalance that would create whatever an angle in the

503
00:59:11.350 --> 00:59:16.110
Julien Lozi: in carries, or some some stupid thing like that.

504
00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:31.870
Barnaby Norris: So even if you're not done, then, yeah, it's going back on the instrument. And you finish on the instrument at all. Yeah, yeah, okay, that's good to know. I mean, I think that's fine. I mean, the the thing that's going to take time, which we might run out of time on is all that you know, software and whatnot. And that's all.

505
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:34.429
Barnaby Norris: Yeah on the instrument, anyway.

506
00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:41.790
Barnaby Norris: But that's yeah. That's that's good. So what I've I've I've written

507
00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:47.669
Barnaby Norris: like this. So the crani is on the eighteenth. So it has to be a couple of days before that basically is the deadline

508
00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:53.200
Barnaby Norris: I mean, the day before is fine. The day of is a little risky.

509
00:59:56.870 --> 01:00:12.610
Barnaby Norris: So what what we'll do basic cause you know, this is what we want to find out is all this stuff that you've been telling us? We'll go back and have a chat at our end, and just sort of work out. Given all this information, you know what the best way is, and before we make any firm commitments, we'll we'll check back in with you. Obviously.

510
01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:15.600
Eckhart Spalding: Okay.

511
01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:21.630
Eckhart Spalding: do. The folks have to leave right now. I see it's past a little past the hour.

512
01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.610
Julien Lozi: I can save it longer.

513
01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:28.090
Eckhart Spalding: Okay, I was just gonna flip back to

514
01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:30.890
Sebastien Vievard: By the way, it's in vampires.

515
01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:35.709
Barnaby Norris: Alright. Cool empires, I see. Cool. Thank you, Saba.

516
01:00:35.830 --> 01:00:37.229
Barnaby Norris: Excellent thanks.

517
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:43.070
Eckhart Spalding: Let's see.

518
01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:46.679
Okay, I think we've answered

519
01:00:47.590 --> 01:00:53.190
Julien Lozi: the point number 2. The connects mount.

520
01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:59.810
Julien Lozi: in the Iow bench.  I think

521
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:05.180
Julien Lozi: if the if glint is of the instrument, then

522
01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:10.509
Julien Lozi: it should be possible, with a too much interference, like

523
01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:13.810
Julien Lozi: what II don't want to do is

524
01:01:13.950 --> 01:01:16.610
Julien Lozi: removed the visible bench to install them.

525
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:22.370
Julien Lozi:  I mean, you know, if we have to, we have to. But ideally

526
01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:27.320
Julien Lozi: I think if Clint is off, then we should be okay.

527
01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:32.690
Barnaby Norris: totally. Yeah, that's a really good point. So make sure we do that at that time.

528
01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:33.700
Eckhart Spalding: Okay.

529
01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:42.270
Julien Lozi:  yeah. The third one spectrograph, so I can send you the dimensions.

530
01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:45.500
Julien Lozi: A

531
01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:52.580
Julien Lozi: quint observation. So that would be October third, twenty-third November 2 and 3,

532
01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:56.429
Julien Lozi: and yep.

533
01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:01.920
Julien Lozi: number 6. Banabino's. So

534
01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:08.079
Barnaby Norris: oh, does he? Okay? Oh, actually, no, no. I know some.

535
01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:30.510
Barnaby Norris: Yeah. But there was also Ollie mentioned. Maybe this actually a sub thing like there's because you were with robin and whatnot for longer term stuff. Are there other ones that are? Because Airbnb, basically, everything's doubled in price like it's insane. So what used to be really cheap is now expensive, but I think there might be cheaper, you know, ones like robins. Or whatever do you guys know

536
01:02:30.990 --> 01:02:32.420
Barnaby Norris: anything like that.

537
01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:46.260
Barnaby Norris: I mean, Robin is an option. If she has face, she still does stuff. Ok. is what's the best way to contact her? Because she's doesn't actually have a website or anything. Does she

538
01:02:47.250 --> 01:02:53.729
Julien Lozi: email? I think you have information. Right?

539
01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:57.310
Olivier Guyon: I have the email somewhere. Yeah, I can dig it up.

540
01:02:57.350 --> 01:03:00.599
Barnaby Norris: Send me an email, Barnaby. So I don't forget.

541
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:02.060
Barnaby Norris: Cool.

542
01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:12.039
Eckhart Spalding: Okay, it sounds like that's everything, for now, is there? Is there anything we're leaving out?

543
01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:17.790
Eckhart Spalding: Anything else the Skxio people need from us before we get back in touch with them.

544
01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:25.069
Julien Lozi: I think once you have the dates, then you need to fill up visitor forms. So just

545
01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:32.430
Barnaby Norris: yeah, yeah, we'll we'll get back in touch with you in the next couple of days. Once we sort of, you know, gone through all this information

546
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.509
Barnaby Norris: final, like, yeah, finest things a bit.

547
01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.530
Julien Lozi: Yeah. Okay.

548
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:44.510
Eckhart Spalding: Thank you. Thanks a lot for the big updates.

549
01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:48.270
Barnaby Norris: Thank you. Look forward to seeing you soon. All right.

550
01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:49.899
Julien Lozi: Excellent, everybody

551
01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.360
Vincent Deo: see you bye, bye.
